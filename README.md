CheckNuts

Your Augmented Reality Vision & Data Verifier (and a little bit nutty!)

About CheckNuts

Welcome to CheckNuts, an Android application designed to help us check and verify filesystem data and explore augmented reality (AR) vision checks.

The Devil is in the details. Small, essential components can, if out of place, drive us nuts.
This project is about meticulously ensuring those crucial "nuts and bolts" of your filesystems and AR visual data are all present, accounted for, and correctly aligned.

What CheckNuts Does & Why It's Useful

What it does:
At its core, CheckNuts aims to provide tools for:

    Filesystem Verification: Scanning and reporting on the structure and integrity of files and folders on an Android device.

    Augmented Reality (AR) "Checks": Experimenting with using the device camera to overlay visual information or perform rudimentary "checks" on real-world objects via AR.

    CI/CD Exploration: Serves as a sandbox for me to learn and implement continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines for Android app development.

Why it's useful (especially for me, right now!):
For me, this project is incredibly useful as a hands-on learning platform. It's designed to demystify CI/CD, streamline development workflows, and provide practical experience in Android app maintenance. While it's a personal learning tool first, the concepts being explored (data integrity, AR applications) have broad utility, and I hope to build features that might be genuinely useful to others down the line. It's about building a robust foundation for future, more ambitious projects.

Project Status

This is a beginner-level, personal project. My primary goal with CheckNuts is to get oriented with CI/CD practices for Android app development and to learn the ropes of building and maintaining an application for a single platform. It's a spare-time endeavor, and while the ambition is there, the scope is currently focused on foundational learning and experimentation.

Features (Planned & In Progress)

    * Filesystem Integrity Checks: Basic scanning and verification of file and folder structures.

    * Augmented Reality Overlays: Early experiments with using the device camera for AR-driven "checks" or visual feedback.

    * CI/CD Pipeline Integration: Setting up automated builds, tests, and potentially deployments to streamline development.

Getting Started

More detailed instructions will be added here as the project progresses. For now, if you're looking to run this project:

    1. Clone the Repository:

    Bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/CheckNuts.git

    2. Open in Android Studio: Open the cloned project directory in Android Studio.

    3. Sync Gradle: Let Gradle sync all the necessary dependencies.

    4. Run the Application: Select an emulator or connected Android device and run the app.

Where to Get Help & Who Maintains It

    * Getting Help: As this is primarily a personal learning project, the main avenue for help is through GitHub Issues. If you encounter a bug, have a question, or a suggestion, please feel free to open an issue.

    * Maintenance & Contributions: CheckNuts is currently maintained and contributed to solely by me ([Your GitHub Username, e.g., @YourUsernameHere]). While I'm not actively seeking external contributions at this initial stage, I welcome constructive feedback via issues.
